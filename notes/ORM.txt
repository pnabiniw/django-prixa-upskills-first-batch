1. ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping
2. It is the way to query the database without having to write the raw SQL
    queries

    * CREATE into classroom (id, name, section) values (1, One, A)
    * Select * from classroom
    * Update Student where id=2
    We donot directly write these queries in django
    Instead we write ORM

3. Using ORM, we can write Python code to query the database

4. Basic ORMs to CRUD in a table in Django
    => Consider a "Classroom" model
    a. Classroom.objects.create(name="One", section="A")
        => This creates a new classroom object / row in table crud_classroom
    
    b. Classroom.objects.all()
        => This ORM returns a queryset of all the classroom objects
        => Querysets are list like objects but they are not actually a list. Also querysets are immutable
        => Queryset also supports slicing
        => Querysets support positive indexing starting from 0
        => Unlike list, querysets don't support negative indexing
        => Querysets can be used as an iterbale in a "for" loop
        => Queryset elements can be accessed using for loop or indexing

        classrooms = Classroom.objects.all()
        for c in classrooms:
            print(c.id)
            print(c.name)
            print(c.section)

    c. Classroom.objects.filter(name="One")
        => .filter() also gives queryset similar to .all()
        c = Clasroom.objects.fiter(name="One")  # [obj, obj, obj]
        print(c[0].name)    
    
    d. Classroom.objects.get(name="One")
        => .get() gives an object (not queryset)
        => This object is a table row
        c = Classroom.objects.get(name="One")
        print(c.name)  # One


        # Edge cases in .get() method
        => If you have multiple classrooms with name "One"
        Classroom.objects.get(name="One")
        This raises Multiple objects returned error

        => If you try to get object which is not there in table
        Classroom.objects.get(id=100)
        This raises DoesNotExist Error

    e. Classroom.objects.filter(id=2).update(name="Ten")
       Classroom.objects.all().update(name="One")
    
       Classroom.objects.get(id=2).update(name="Ten")
        => We are not allowed to write this
        => This raise Attribute error (classroom object has no attribute update)

    f. Classroom.objects.filter(name="One").delete()
       Classroom.objects.all().delete()
       Classroom.objects.get(id=2).delete() => Unlike update this is possible possible for delete()
