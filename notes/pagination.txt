There are two types of Pagination in DRF
1. PageNumberPagination
2. LimitOffSetPagination


1. In PagenumberPagination data are break down in each page
    => If we have 100 data then we can decide how many data can be shown in a single page
    => This number of data in each page is in the control of Backend (not Frontend)

    http://127.0.0.1/api/student/?page=1
    PAGE_SIZE = 5

2. In LimitOffSetPagination we can control the number of data in each page using Limit value
    => limit=5 offset=10
    => Limit is the number of data in each page
    => Offset is the starting point


    limit=10 offset=90
